This is a work in progress cheat for the game Word's with Friends. The nature of this cheat is a Greedy Algorithm. This cheat will only assess the potential present moves. It will make no decision about moves in the future.

## Back story
This idea came about because I was playing words with friends with various people and I found myself attempting to put certain letters on the board for words that I wasn't sure existed in order to get maximum points. I soon realised how time consuming this was and thought it'd be great to have an application that could do this for me. 

## How I intend it to work
1. Screenshot your current WWF board
2. Put the screenshot into the app and enter your current letters
3. The application will then scan the empty spots, the current words on the board & your letters
4. Application will then decide based on WWF dictionary of words which words can be played
5. By using the scanned board the application will decide which words will able to be played and what scores
